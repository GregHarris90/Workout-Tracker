# Repository

- This repository is for a web application to create, track, and update workouts. The user can then view various charts & graphs showing the input data about their workouts on a weekly basis.

# Technology-Used

- To build this project I was tasked in building the backend server, models, and routes for a Mongo Database. 

- To accomplish this goal I used 'express' to build the server and then 'mongoose' to manage the information in the database. 

- Also in the provided code it required using 'morgan,' which is an HTTP request logger middleware for NodeJS.

# User-Story

- To begin the application the user goes to the main-page where they can see the 'Last Workout.'

- Then the user can also navigate to the Dashboard to view their workout 'stats.' 

- Or select 'Continue Workout to edit the 'Last Workout' or add a 'New Workout.'

- Once they press on 'New Workout' they're taking to a page to choose if it's type, either 'Cardio' or 'Resistance.'

- After choosing it's type the user is taken to the relevant page to input the information about the 'New Workout.' 

- When the workout is completed they can press 'Add Exercise' to add the workout to the database, or press 'Complete' to add the workout and return to the main-page.

- Once all exercises are added the user will likely go view their workouts 'stats' by pressing the 'Dashboard' button on the main-page.

# Conclusion

- Overall this assignment went fairly well. The biggest challenge was understanding the provided front-end code so that I could properly build the backend. I had some issues debugging my routes and making sure all the paths worked correctly. I had to rewrite various parts and work through the activities again to understand what I had missed. I'm currently still working on one last issue with the duration being 'undefined' and this is making one of the graphs & pie charts not work. I'm hoping to fix it in office hours tomorrow and then have a fully functional application. Thank you!
